# lambda-rabbitmq-integration
This repository contains two AWS Lambda functions in Python that connect to RabbitMQ and push messages to a queue. One function uses environment variables for configuration, while the other retrieves credentials from AWS Secrets Manager. This setup ensures flexible and secure management of RabbitMQ connection details.
